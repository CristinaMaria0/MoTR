genome,3,1,"When scientists first learned how to edit the genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the ways they could use this new power. Creating brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority. Instead, most researchers envisioned far more consequential applications, hoping to create genetically engineered animals that saved human lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream. Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living pharmaceutical factories. @#@Many of the proteins that our cells crank out naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies",1,Question 1. The primary purpose of the passage is to,1) present the background of a medical breakthrough.,2) evaluate the research that led to a scientific discovery.,3) summarize the findings of a long-term research project.,4) explain the development of a branch of scientific study.,1
genome,3,2,"are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy animals, on the other hand, are expert protein producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice, then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the gene in just the right place, under the control of the right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer animals that produced healing human proteins in their milk. Then doctors could collect",2,Question 2. The author’s attitude toward pharming is best described as one of,1) apprehension.,2) ambivalence.,3) appreciation.,4) astonishment.,3
genome,3,3,"medicine by the bucketful.@#@Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk. At first, this work was merely geewhiz, scientific geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true. That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the Massachusetts firm GIC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound, made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer, sidling up to",3,Question 3. What does the author suggest about the transgenic studies done in the 1980s and 1990s?,1) They were limited by the expensive nature of animal research.,2) They were not expected to yield products ready for human use.,3) They were completed when an anticoagulant compound was identified.,"4) They focused only on the molecular properties of cows, goats, and sheep.",2
genome,3,4,"clot-forming compounds and escorting them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in 2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation that prevents them from making antithrombin. These patients are prone to clots, especially in their legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of suffering from fatal complications during surgery and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can reduce this risk, and GIC decided to try to manufacture the compound using genetically engineered goats.@#@To create its special herd of goats, GTC used microinjection, the same technique that produced GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and injected it directly into",4,"Question 4. According to the passage, which of the following is true of antithrombin?",1) It reduces compounds that lead to blood clots.,2) It stems from a genetic mutation that is rare in humans.,3) It is a sequence of DNA known as a promoter.,4) It occurs naturally in goats’ mammary glands.,1
genome,3,5,"goat eggs. Then they implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats. When the kids were born, some of them proved to be transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that controls gene activity) that is normally active in the goat's mammary glands during milk production. When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled with milk containing antithrombin. All that was left to do was to collect the milk, and extract and purify the protein. Et voila—human medicin! And, for GTC, liquid gold. ATryn hit the market in 2006, becoming the world’s first transgenic animal",5,Question 5. Which of the following does the author suggest about the “female goats” in line 32,1) They secreted antithrombin in their milk after giving birth.,2) Some of their kids were not born with the antithrombin gene.,3) They were the first animals to receive microinjections.,4) Their cells already contained genes usually found in humans.,2
