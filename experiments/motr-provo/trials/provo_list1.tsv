provo	2	real	1	1	There are now rumblings that Apple might soon invade the smart watch space, though the company is maintaining its customary silence. The watch doesn't have a microphone or speaker, but you can use it to control the music on your phone. You can glance at the watch face to view the artist and title of a song.	Will the new phone include a microphone?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	2	Two days later, the British astronomer Richard Carrington was observing the interesting sunspot group through his telescope when he saw what he described as "two patches of intensely bright and white light" over the sunspots. He jotted a note in his painstaking record. That night there was scarcely a square inch of earth that was not illuminated by aurora.	Did Richard Carrington observe moon spots?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	3	I agree that California's "three strikes and you're out" law will be a financial disaster for taxpayers who care about education and other vital services. But it's far from clear that the law can even be credited with a reduction in crime in California. While it's true that crime declined in California last year, crime also dropped nationwide.	Did the “three strikes law” clearly reduce crime?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	4	Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.	Was Liza in a bad temper? 	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	5	Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her.	Did Mrs. Darling notice the stars outside her window?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	6	Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.	Was Peter carrying a gun?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	7	Dorothy didn't know. She looked around her anxiously for some familiar landmark; but everything was strange. Between the branches of the many roads were green meadows and a few shrubs and trees, but she couldn't see the farm-house from which she had just come, or anything she had ever seen before, except the shaggy man and Toto.	Did Dorothy recognize any familiar landmark?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	8	The human body can tolerate only a small range of temperature, especially when the person is engaged in vigorous activity. Heat reactions usually occur when large amounts of water and/or salt are lost through excessive sweating following strenuous exercise. When the body becomes overheated and cannot eliminate this excess heat, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are possible.	Does heat stroke occur when the body cannot eliminate the excess heat?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	9	It was a forbidding challenge, and it says much for Winstanley's persuasive abilities, not to mention his self-confidence, that the admiralty agreed to fund him. No lighthouse had ever been built out to sea on an isolated rock before. The Eddystone is hard enough to avoid, but landing on it is a separate challenge entirely.	Did the admiralty agree to fund Winstanley's project of building a lighthouse on an isolated rock?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	10	A clergyman remarked to him, "The Lord is on our side." I am not at all concerned about that, replied Mr. Lincoln; "for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right. But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord's side."	Did a Judge speak to Mr. Lincoln?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	11	Known as Rapa Nui to the island's inhabitants, Rongorongo is a writing system comprised of pictographs. It has been found carved into many oblong wooden tablets and other artifacts from the island's history. The art of writing was not known in any nearby islands and the script's mere existence is sufficient to confound anthropologists.	Is Rongorongo a musical script?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	12	Some months later, Michael Larson saw another opportunity to stack the odds in his favor with a dash of ingenuity. He walked into his bank one day and asked to withdraw his entire account balance, but with an unusual stipulation: He wanted as much of the cash as possible in one dollar notes.	Did Michael Larson ask his bank to withdraw his entire account balance in one dollar notes?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	13	Bob Murphy, the Senior PGA Tour money leader with seven hundred thousand, says heat shouldn't be a factor. "I don't think you're going to have a heat wave I'm not going to be able to handle," he said. "Everybody treats it differently. My son Ronnie, his caddie, and I won't be riding carts."	Is heat not a factor for Bob Murphy?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	14	With schools still closed, cars still buried and streets still blocked by the widespread weekend snowstorm, officials are asking people to pick up a shovel and help out. In Boston, a "snow angel" campaign is using social media to encourage neighbors and friends to be an angel and help dig out the stranded.	Are officials asking people to pick up a shovel and help out with the widespread weekend snowstorm?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	15	Greg Anderson, considered a key witness by the prosecution, vowed he wouldn't testify when served a subpoena last week. His lawyers said he was prepared for a third prison stay to maintain his silence. Anderson was released July 20 after a two-week stay for previously declining to testify before a different grand jury.	Did Greg Anderson vow not to testify when served a subpoena last week?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	16	Steam sterilization is limited in the types of medical waste it can treat, but is appropriate for laboratory cultures and substances contaminated with infectious organisms. The waste is subjected to steam in a sealed, pressurized chamber. The liquid that may form is drained off to the sewer or sent for processing.	Is steam sterilization appropriate for laboratory cultures and substances contaminated with infectious organisms?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	17	Owls are more flexible than humans because a bird's head is only connected by one socket pivot. People have two, which limits our ability to twist, Forsman added. Owls also have multiple vertebrae, the small bones that make up the neck and spine, helping them achieve a wide range of motion.	Are owls more flexible than humans?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	18	Even in the same animal, not all bites are the same. A new study finds that because the force in a muscle depends on how much it is stretched, an animal's bite force depends on the size of what it is biting. The finding has direct implications for ecology and evolution.	Does an animal's bite force depend on the size of what it is biting?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	19	Interestingly, the heaviest isotopes physicists have managed to synthesize so far don't behave quite like science's best current models predict, so stable superheavy nuclei are likely to be full of surprises. Chemists cannot even predict with any certainty whether these materials will exist as gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature.	Can stable superheavy nuclei be full of surprises?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	20	Buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in it. It was a monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was very like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out, fires were built, and breakfast was eaten.	Did Buck enjoy his monotonous life? 	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	21	These days, neuroscience is beginning to catch up to musicians who practice mentally. Although the details are still somewhat elusive, the key to the success of mental imagery as a rehearsal technique is that most of the same neurological regions are invoked by mental practice as by real practice.	Are most of the same neurological regions invoked by mental practice as by real practice?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	22	Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's voices, for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees.	Did the pirates hear the children's voices?	Yes	No
provo	2	real	1	23	When a nucleus has all of its proton shells or neutron shells loaded to full capacity, the layers can align so well that each shell can spoon intimately with its attractive neighbors, forming a more compact sphere that fits well within the strong nuclear force's area of influence.	Is the passage about astronomy?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	24	Hybrid vehicles have a halo that makes owners feel righteous and their neighbors feel guilty for not doing as much to save the planet. They also cost more and a new report from the very green Union of Concerned Scientists says buyers aren't always getting their money's worth.	Does the report from the Union of Concerned Scientists say that buyers always get their money's worth when purchasing hybrid vehicles?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	25	The girl's feet were then re-wrapped even tighter than before, causing her footprint to shrink further as the bones slowly fused into their new configuration. Occasionally girls' feet would fester, and blood poisoning from gangrene could be a cause for concern, but an estimated 90% survived the process.	Do all girls survive the process of foot binding?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	26	An early task will be to make sure the newfound microbes were not introduced while drilling through the ice into the lake, which involved a hot-water drilling technique designed to greatly reduce or eliminate any contamination that might come from other kerosene-based drilling technology, Christner said.	Were the scientists drilling in the ocean?	No	Yes
provo	2	real	1	27	Very similar, but even more striking, is the evidence from athletic training. As with rehearsing a piece on the piano, practicing a complex physical task in the mind alone is nearly as effective a learning strategy as actually physically doing it. But it doesn’t stop there.	Is practicing a complex physical task in the mind an effective rehearsal strategy?	Yes	No
